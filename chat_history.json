You want to create a mobile app for children with autism to help them understand \"WH\" questions (who, what, when, where, why). The app will present a question with four picture choices, and the child selects the correct answer. The questions should be relevant to daily life at home, school, and other environments. Additionally, you need a progress tracking feature to monitor the child's performance.\n\nHere's a plan to get started:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n-   **Home Screen:** A welcoming screen with clear navigation to different question categories (e.g., \"Home,\" \"School,\" \"Other\").\n-   **Question Screens:** Each screen will display a \"WH\" question with four associated pictures as answer choices.\n-   **Progress Tracking:** A simple system to record correct and incorrect answers, displayed as a percentage or a basic chart.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#F9F9F9` (Very light grey)\n    *   Text: `#333333` (Dark grey)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#666666` (Medium grey)\n    *   Primary: `#4285F4` (Blue)\n    *   Secondary: `#DB4437` (Red)\n    *   Accent: `#F4B400` (Yellow)\n    *   Card: `#FFFFFF` (White)\n    *   Highlight: `#E0E0E0` (Light grey)\n*   **Typography:** Use a clear, easy-to-read font like \"Roboto\" or \"Open Sans.\"\n\nNow, let's create a plan for the coding agent to implement these features.\n\n**Plan for the Coding Agent:**\n\n1.  **Project Setup:** Ensure the project is a React Native + Expo 54 project.\n2.  **File Structure:**\n    *   Create a `components` folder for reusable components (e.g., `QuestionCard`, `AnswerButton`, `ProgressChart`).\n    *   Create a `screens` folder to hold the different screens of the app (e.g., `HomeScreen`, `QuestionScreen`, `ProgressScreen`).\n3.  **Implement the Home Screen:**\n    *   Create a `HomeScreen` component in `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`.\n    *   Add buttons or touchable elements for navigating to the different question categories (\"Home,\" \"School,\" \"Other\").\n4.  **Implement the Question Screen:**\n    *   Create a `QuestionScreen` component in `screens/QuestionScreen.tsx`.\n    *   This component should:\n        *   Display a \"WH\" question.\n        *   Display four image options as answer choices.\n        *   Handle user selection and determine if the answer is correct.\n        *   Update the progress tracking data.\n5.  **Implement the Progress Tracking:**\n    *   Create a `ProgressScreen` component in `screens/ProgressScreen.tsx`.\n    *   Store the progress data (correct/incorrect answers) using React state or a simple data structure.\n    *   Display the progress data in an easily understandable format (e.g., percentage, bar chart).\n6.  **Navigation:**\n    *   Set up navigation between the `HomeScreen`, `QuestionScreen`, and `ProgressScreen` using React Navigation.\n7.  **Styling:**\n    *   Apply the specified color palette and typography to all components.\n8.  **Data:**\n    *   The modalDemos array from app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx should be removed.\n\nLet's create an elegant and functional mobile app!\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-11-29T15:45:17.814202"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you create an educational WH-questions app for children with autism.

Let me provide you with comprehensive testing instructions and also verify the question count.\n\n## How to Test Your App\n\n### **Option 1: Test on Your Phone with Expo Go (Recommended)**\n\n1. **Install Expo Go on your phone:**\n   - iOS: Download from the App Store\n   - Android: Download from Google Play Store\n\n2. **Start the development server:**\n   - Open your terminal in the project directory\n   - Run: `npm run dev` or `expo start --tunnel`\n\n3. **Connect your phone:**\n   - **iOS**: Open the Camera app and scan the QR code shown in the terminal\n   - **Android**: Open Expo Go app and scan the QR code\n\n4. **Test the app:**\n   - The app should load on your phone\n   - Try selecting different categories (Home, School, Other Places)\n   - Answer questions and see if feedback works\n   - Check the Progress screen to see your stats\n\n### **Option 2: Test on iOS Simulator (Mac only)**\n\n1. Run: `npm run ios`\n2. The iOS simulator will open automatically\n\n### **Option 3: Test on Android Emulator**\n\n1. Make sure you have Android Studio installed with an emulator set up\n2. Run: `npm run android`\n3. The Android emulator will open automatically\n\n### **Option 4: Test on Web Browser**\n\n1. Run: `npm run web`\n2. Your browser will open with the app\n\n---\n\n## Current Issue: Only 17 Questions Available\n\nLooking at your `data/questions.ts` file, I can see you currently have only **17 questions total**, not 50 per WH type.

This means a total of 50 * 5 * 3 = 750 questions.\n2.  **Address Existing Issue:** Identify and resolve the issue where the app currently only displays 7 questions.\n\nTo address this, I would suggest the following approach:\n\n*   **Data Structure:** Ensure the question data is structured efficiently, likely in a JSON format, to facilitate easy loading and management.\n*   **Loading Mechanism:** Implement a mechanism to load the question data into the app, potentially from a local JSON file or, ideally, from a Supabase database for scalability and maintainability.\n*   **Debugging:** Thoroughly debug the app to identify why only 7 questions are currently displayed.

Fixed Picture Mismatches in Articulation & Daily Words\n\nI've updated the image URLs in both `data/articulationWords.ts` and `data/dailyWords.ts` to better match the words. Key improvements include:\n\n**Articulation Words:**\n- Better images for actions like \"Ask\", \"Jump\", \"Play\", \"Up\"\n- More appropriate images for emotions like \"Happy\", \"Nice\"\n- Clearer images for body parts like \"Ear\", \"Nose\", \"Mouth\"\n- Better representations for \"Yes\", \"No\", \"Friend\", \"Girl\", \"Mom\"\n\n**Daily Words:**\n- Fixed \"Yes\" to show a positive/thumbs up image\n- Fixed \"No\" to show a stop/negative gesture\n- Better images for actions like \"Jump\", \"Play\"\n- More appropriate images for \"Friends\" showing people together\n\n## 2. Transformed Logo Game into Interactive Picture Puzzle\n\nThe Logo Builder is now a **Picture Puzzle Game** where kids build pictures by assembling pieces! Features include:\n\n### Key Features:\n- **9-Piece Puzzle**: Each picture is divided into a 3x3 grid (9 pieces)\n- **Tap to Swap**: Tap one piece, then tap another to swap their positions\n- **Preview Mode**: Shows the complete picture for 3 seconds at start, can be toggled with eye icon\n- **Multiple Pictures**: Choose from 5 beautiful images (Rainbow, Sunset, Flower, Ocean, Butterfly)\n- **Visual Feedback**: \n  - Selected pieces have a blue border\n  - Pieces fit together seamlessly when correct\n  - Success celebration when puzzle is complete\n- **Audio Feedback**: Speaks encouragement and announces picture selection\n- **Haptic Feedback**: Vibrations for interactions and success\n- **Try Again**: Reset button to shuffle and try the same puzzle again\n\n### How It Works:\n1. Child sees a preview of the complete picture\n2. Puzzle pieces are shuffled randomly\n3. Child taps one piece (it gets highlighted)\n4. Child taps another piece to swap positions\n5. Continue swapping until the picture is complete\n6. Celebration when finished with option to try again or choose a new picture\n\nThis is much more engaging and educational than the previous shape-building game, helping with:\n- Visual-spatial skills\n- Problem-solving\n- Pattern recognition\n- Fine motor skills\n- Persistence and completion\n\nThe game is intuitive, colorful, and provides immediate feedback - perfect for autism kids!"}, {"type": "lint", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "lint", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "build", "build_type": "build", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "commit", "commit_id": "40d39146dad78ee86d64263e19cb1c463129379a", "message": "feat: Transform logo game into interactive picture puzzle", "timestamp": "2025-11-30T13:03:25Z", "files_changed": ["data/articulationWords.ts", "app/logo-builder.tsx", "data/dailyWords.ts"], "update_number": 9, "parent_commit_id": "e65dcf89862822033c86a5741f0d29293f7c78d1"}], "timestamp": "2025-11-30T12:59:27Z"}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "No still images are not correct like Ant,Arm,,chair,door,doll,eye,forlk etc all have not correct images.Please add image belongs to words"}]}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Okay, I understand.
