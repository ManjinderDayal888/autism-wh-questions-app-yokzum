You want to create a mobile app for children with autism to help them understand \"WH\" questions (who, what, when, where, why). The app will present a question with four picture choices, and the child selects the correct answer. The questions should be relevant to daily life at home, school, and other environments. Additionally, you need a progress tracking feature to monitor the child's performance.\n\nHere's a plan to get started:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n-   **Home Screen:** A welcoming screen with clear navigation to different question categories (e.g., \"Home,\" \"School,\" \"Other\").\n-   **Question Screens:** Each screen will display a \"WH\" question with four associated pictures as answer choices.\n-   **Progress Tracking:** A simple system to record correct and incorrect answers, displayed as a percentage or a basic chart.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#F9F9F9` (Very light grey)\n    *   Text: `#333333` (Dark grey)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#666666` (Medium grey)\n    *   Primary: `#4285F4` (Blue)\n    *   Secondary: `#DB4437` (Red)\n    *   Accent: `#F4B400` (Yellow)\n    *   Card: `#FFFFFF` (White)\n    *   Highlight: `#E0E0E0` (Light grey)\n*   **Typography:** Use a clear, easy-to-read font like \"Roboto\" or \"Open Sans.\"\n\nNow, let's create a plan for the coding agent to implement these features.\n\n**Plan for the Coding Agent:**\n\n1.  **Project Setup:** Ensure the project is a React Native + Expo 54 project.\n2.  **File Structure:**\n    *   Create a `components` folder for reusable components (e.g., `QuestionCard`, `AnswerButton`, `ProgressChart`).\n    *   Create a `screens` folder to hold the different screens of the app (e.g., `HomeScreen`, `QuestionScreen`, `ProgressScreen`).\n3.  **Implement the Home Screen:**\n    *   Create a `HomeScreen` component in `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`.\n    *   Add buttons or touchable elements for navigating to the different question categories (\"Home,\" \"School,\" \"Other\").\n4.  **Implement the Question Screen:**\n    *   Create a `QuestionScreen` component in `screens/QuestionScreen.tsx`.\n    *   This component should:\n        *   Display a \"WH\" question.\n        *   Display four image options as answer choices.\n        *   Handle user selection and determine if the answer is correct.\n        *   Update the progress tracking data.\n5.  **Implement the Progress Tracking:**\n    *   Create a `ProgressScreen` component in `screens/ProgressScreen.tsx`.\n    *   Store the progress data (correct/incorrect answers) using React state or a simple data structure.\n    *   Display the progress data in an easily understandable format (e.g., percentage, bar chart).\n6.  **Navigation:**\n    *   Set up navigation between the `HomeScreen`, `QuestionScreen`, and `ProgressScreen` using React Navigation.\n7.  **Styling:**\n    *   Apply the specified color palette and typography to all components.\n8.  **Data:**\n    *   The modalDemos array from app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx should be removed.\n\nLet's create an elegant and functional mobile app!\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-11-29T15:45:17.814202"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you create an educational WH-questions app for children with autism.
